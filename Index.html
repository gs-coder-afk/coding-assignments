<!-- main header i used for a greeting to the site . 
 followed by the subject matter , i chose my favorite bands . 
 i made another bullet point list . each band name in a smaller header size . 
 followed by an image , each image i chose to showcase the band members . 
 i altered a few of the image sizes to be more uniform & gave them brief descriptions .
 alt is giving the description when an image fails to load & height with px after the 
 numerical value is how i changed the size of each image .
