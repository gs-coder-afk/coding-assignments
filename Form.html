<!-- the "form" element used here i gave the option to the user to submit their own 
 favorite artist , songs , & albums . 
 each box for the user to type is available by input element & text . text because 
 the user will be typing wiht their keyboard . the label is to better format the boxes 
 making it a bit more obvious to what each input or box is for . i then used br 
 inbetween each input to have them shown in a single colum
